export const symptomInfo = {
    "RedundantException": <p>A specific exception is caught using <code>except</code> then immediately raised. 
    Suggests confusion about how to work with exceptions.</p>,
    "UndefinedVariable": <p>A variable that was not declared is called. Depending on context, may be due to sloppiness (e.g. a typo) 
        or may suggest misconception about variable scope, function parameters, or how to call functions.
    </p>,
    "UnusedVariable": <p>A variable is not used after initialisation. May be an oversight but could potentially indicate 
        misconceptions about variables.
    </p>,
    "UnusedValue": <p>A value (either a single variable or a compound expression) is created but not assigned to a variable, passed 
        as a function argument, or used in some other way.
    </p>,
    "VariableOverwrite": <p>A variable's value is initialised or changed then overwritten without being used.
    </p>,
    "UnreachableCode.exitKeyword": <p>Code that is unreachable because it follows a <code>return</code> or <code>break</code> statement. 
    This might indicate a misconception about how those keywords affect the flow of control.</p>,
    "UnreachableCode.exhaustiveConditional": <p>Code that is unreachable because it follows a conditional with an <code>else</code> branch 
    in which all branches exit (e.g. due to a <code>return</code> statement).</p>,
    "UnreachableCode.infiniteLoop": <p>Code this is unreachable because it follows an infinite <code>while</code> loop.</p>,
    "UnreachableCode": <p>Code that is unreachable because if follows a <code>return</code> or <code>break</code> statement, a conditional 
    with an <code>else</code> branch in which all branches exit, or an infinite <code>while</code> loop.</p>,
    "InvalidCalculation": <p>A calculation combining incompatible types and/or operators, resulting in a <code>TypeError</code>.</p>,
    "TypeError.unnecessary": <p>A value that has a guaranteed data type is passed to a type conversion function that produces the same 
        data type.
    </p>,
    "LoopEarlyExit": <p>A <code>return</code> or <code>break</code> statement causes a loop to always exit on the first iteration.</p>,
    "WhileLoopVarNotModified": <p>None of the variables found in a while loop definition are modified in the body of the loop. If the loop contains a nested loop, any modifications of the outer loop variable within the nested loop are ignored.</p>,
    "WhileLoopVarModifiedInChildLoop": <p>A while loop variable is modified in a nested for or while loop.</p>,
    "InfiniteLoop": <p>A while loop that does not exit, either because it begins <code>while True</code> and has no <code>return</code> or <code>break</code> statement, or because no loop variable is modified and there is no exit statement.</p>,
    "BooleanSyntax.naturalLanguage": <p>A Boolean expression checking if a particular expression is equal to one of a range of 
        values uses <code>or</code> in a way that makes sense in natural language but may produce unexpected results in Python. For 
        example, <code>x == 5 or 6</code>.
    </p>,
    "BooleanSyntax.andOr": <p>A Boolean expression contains <code>and or</code>.</p>,
    "BooleanSyntax.assignment": <p>An assignment operator is used in a Boolean expression. This could be a typo or an indication of 
        confusion about <code>=</code> and <code>==</code>.
    </p>,
    "BooleanSyntax.doubleOperators": <p>Two comparison operators are used side by side. This may be due to an extra space e.g. <code>{'<='}</code> is 
    written as <code>{'<'} =</code></p>,
    "BooleanSyntax.outOfPlace": <p>A comparison or logical operator is used in an expected place in a conditional expression.</p>,
    "BooleanSyntaxError": <p>A syntax error in a boolean expression e.g. an out of place comparison operator.</p>,
    "OneLineConditional": <p>A conditional that could be re-written as one line. Although this is not an error, it may indicate a 
        misconception about Boolean values.
    </p>,
    "CompareBoolLiteral": <p>A Boolean expression is compared to a Boolean literal. Although this is not an error, it may indicate 
        a misconception about Boolean values.
    </p>,
    "AssignmentInReturn": <p>A variable is assigned in a <code>return</code> statement.</p>,
    "AssignedNoReturn": <p>A function or method that does not return a value is assigned to a variable, passed as an argument, or used 
        in some way. Commonly seen with the <code>print()</code> function.
    </p>,
    "FunctionPrints": <p>A user-defined function contains <code>print</code> statements. This is not an issue 
    unless <code>AssignedNoReturn</code> is also present and <code>print</code> statements are used in place of <code>return</code> statements.</p>,
    "UnusedReturn": <p>The result of a call to a function / method that returns a value is not used in some way.</p>,
    "WrongArgNumber": <p>A user-defined function is called with the wrong number of arguments.</p>,
    "UnknownFunction": <p>A function that is not defined in the file or built in to Python is called. Could be a typo or a misunderstanding 
        about variables.
    </p>,
    "VariableWithSameNameAsFunction": <p>A variable has the same name as a function.</p>,
    "SubscriptedNonSubscriptable": <p>Square brackets follow a variable name that does not have a subscriptable type (i.e. is not a string, list, tuple, or dictionary)</p>,
    "ReturnInParentheses": <p>The return keyword is followed by a value or compound expression in parentheses. May suggest a belief that returned values must be encapsulated in parentheses.</p>,
    "SequentialIfs": <p>Multiple if statements appear in sequence with no other code between the if blocks. Depending on the contents of the boolean expressions and each block, it may indicate a misconception about how conditionals are evaluated.</p>,
    "WhileTrue": <p>A while loop is defined to iterate forever. This is a valid approach but may be a contributor to misconceptions when combined with other symptoms.</p>,
    "TernaryReturnsBool": <p>A ternary returns a boolean. Although this is not an error, it may indicate a misconception about Boolean values.</p>,
    "DefinitionFollowedByReservedWord": <p>A definition keyword (def or class) is followed by a reserved word, suggesting the intention to define a function or class with the same name as a reserved word.</p>,
    "ReservedWordAssigned": <p>A reserved word is followed by the assignment operator, suggesting an intention to create a variable with the same name as a reserved word.</p>,
    "ForLoopIteratorModified": <p>A for loop iterator variable is modified in the loop.</p>,
    "WhileLoopVarAssignedIntLiteral": <p>A while loop counter variable is assigned an int value rather than incremented.</p>,
    "UnexpectedColon": <p>A colon is found where one is not expected, indicating either a typo or a misunderstanding of syntax.</p>,
    "UnknownMethod": <p>An unknown method, or a method that is not valid is called on a value with known data type.</p>
