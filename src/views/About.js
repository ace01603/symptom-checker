    <h2>The Symptom Checker</h2>
    <p>Use this website to search Python 3 source code for symptoms of misconceptions about basic 
        Python programming concepts. A <HashLink smooth to="#symptoms"><em>symptom</em></HashLink> is a pattern in a statement of block of 
        code that is associated with one or more <HashLink smooth to="#misconceptions">misconceptions</HashLink>. Symptoms are distinct from misconceptions 
        because different misconceptions may exhibit the same symptoms. For example, an undefined 
        variable is a symptom. Depending on the presence of other symptoms, it could indicate a 
        misconception about variable values or scope, syntax of function calls, or it could just 
        be a typo. Symptoms are also distinct from errors as misconceptions may be apparent in 
        code that produces correct output.
    </p>
    <p>For more information about symptoms and misconceptions, please see our paper: Abigail Evans, Zihan Wang, Jieren Liu, and 
        Mingming Zheng. 2023. SIDE-lib: A Library for Detecting Symptoms of Python Programming 
        Misconceptions. n Proceedings of the 2023 Conference on Innovation and Technology in Computer Science Education V. 1 (ITiCSE 2023), July 8â€“12, 2023, Turku, Finland. ACM, New York, NY, USA, 7 pages. <a href="https://doi.org/10.1145/3587102.3588838" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">https://doi.org/10.1145/3587102.3588838</a></p>
    <h3 className="serif">How to Use</h3>
    <p>Go to <Link to="/select-source">Select Source</Link> and choose either a single .py file or a folder. 
    If a folder is selected, the Symptom Checker will analyse all .py files in the folder, including those in 
    nested folders. Detected symptoms and misconceptions will be shown in <Link to="/summary">summary</Link> tables. Go to 
    the <Link to="/file-view">File View</Link> tab to inspect individual files. The <Link to="/file-view">File View</Link> tab 
    includes a filter to select files with specific symptoms or misconceptions.</p>
    <h3 className="serif">Important Details (and Known Limitations)</h3>
    <p>The symptom checker is powered by <a href="https://github.com/Supportive-IDE/SIDE-lib" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">SIDE-lib</a>, a library we have developed that parses text and forms a custom <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abstract_syntax_tree" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Abstract 
    Syntax Tree (AST)</a> containing information about expressions, statements, and blocks of code. SIDE-lib is completely standalone 
    and based purely on text parsing, 
    meaning it does not interact with the Python interpreter or intercept run time errors. SIDE-lib is able to identify and 
    track many Python constructs such as variables, function definitions, most built-in functions, built-in methods used with 
    common data types (e.g. String methods), literals, loops, and common data types (ints, floats, booleans, strings, lists, 
    dictionaries, tuples, and sets). However, the library is not a complete parser. <strong>The following constructs are not currently handled</strong>:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>User-defined classes</li>
        <li>Imported modules, with the exception of the following built in modules: <code>random</code>, <code>math</code>, <code>string</code>, <code>re</code>, <code>pattern</code>, <code>match</code>, <code>sys</code>.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Although support for classes will be added in the near future, the current version of the symptom checker may produce unexpected or unreliable results when analysing files that contain imported modules or 
        user-defined classes.
    </p>
    <p>Where possible, SIDE-lib infers the data type of literals and variables and the return type(s) of user-defined functions. It also 
        tracks the return type of most supported built-in functions and methods. <strong>SIDE-lib uses the following rules to determine 
        type</strong>:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Where an expression is <em>guaranteed</em> to have a single data type, it is assigned that type in the custom AST. For example, 
        consider the following code:
        <pre>{
            "x = 10\n" + 
            "y = input(\"Enter your name:\")"
        }
        </pre>
        The literal, 10, is guaranteed to be an integer. As 10 is assigned directly to <code>x</code>, <code>x</code> is also guaranteed 
        to be an integer. The built in function <code>input()</code> will always return a string, therefore <code>y</code> must be a string.
        </li>
        <li>If the data type of a particular expression is ambiguous or not determined, it will be treated as having "unknown" data type.</li>
        <li>Data types are only inferred at the highest level e.g. a list variable will be identified as a list data type but the data type(s) 
            of the list contents will not be tracked.</li>
        <li>Expressions that involve an unknown data type are assumed to be valid unless it can be inferred by other means that the expression 
            is not valid. The evaluated type of a valid expression involving an unknown 
            data type will also be unknown. For example, in the code below, <code>lst</code> is treated as a list data type but the 
            type of <code>lst[0]</code> is unknown.
            <pre>{
                "lst = [\"a\", 1.5, True]\n" +
                "print(lst[0] + lst[1])"
            }</pre>
            <code>lst[0] + lst[1]</code> involves two unknown data types according to SIDE-lib. With knowledge of the specific list items 
            involved in the expression, it is clear that the expression will lead to a <code>TypeError</code>. However, because SIDE-lib 
            does not currently determine the types of list items, and <code>&lt;unknown list item&gt; + &lt;unknown list item&gt;</code> <em>could</em> be 
            valid depending on the specific data types involved, <code>lst[0] + lst[1]</code> is inferred to be a valid expression with evaluated type 
            of "unknown".
        </li>
        <li>When an expression has syntax issues or identifiable type errors, SIDE-lib marks it as having "invalid" type and continues parsing the rest of the file.</li>
        <li>Parameters in user-defined functions are treated as having unknown data type.</li>
        <li>When a function (user-defined or built-in) has multiple return types, calls to that function are treated as having unknown data type.</li>
        <li>The data types of arguments provided in function calls are not validated.</li>
    </ul>
